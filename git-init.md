To push a folder containing files to a Git repository, you need to follow these general steps. I'll assume that you've already initialized a Git repository in the destination location (if not, you can use `git init` to do so).

1. **Navigate to the folder in your terminal or command prompt:**

   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/folder
   ```

2. **Initialize a Git repository if you haven't done so:**

   ```bash
   git init
   ```

3. **Add the files to the staging area:**

   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

   The `.` means to add all files in the current directory.

4. **Commit the changes:**

   ```bash
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   ```

   Replace "Initial commit" with a meaningful commit message describing the changes you made.

5. **Create a new repository on GitHub (if you haven't already):**

   - Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/).
   - Log in to your account.
   - Click on the '+' sign in the top right corner and select "New repository".
   - Follow the instructions to create a new repository.

6. **Add the remote repository URL:**

   Copy the repository URL provided by GitHub.

   ```bash
   git remote add origin <repository-url>
   ```

   Replace `<repository-url>` with the actual URL you copied.

7. **Push your changes:**

   ```bash
   git push -u origin master
   ```

   This command will push the changes to the master branch of your remote repository. If you're using a different branch, replace `master` with the appropriate branch name.

Remember, these are general steps, and you might need to adjust them based on your specific situation. Always refer to the documentation of the version control system or the platform you are using (e.g., GitHub, GitLab) for the most accurate and up-to-date information.

The error message you're encountering suggests that there is a submodule or an empty directory in your repository, and Git is unable to add it directly using `git add .`. You may have an empty directory or a submodule (a separate Git repository) within your "day-01/" directory.

Here's a step-by-step guide on how you can handle this situation:

1. **Check for Submodules:**

   - If "day-01/" is a submodule, you need to initialize and update it before adding files.
     ```bash
     git submodule init
     git submodule update
     ```

2. **Check for Empty Directories:**

   - If there's an empty directory, Git might not track it directly. You can add a placeholder file inside the directory and then add it.
     ```bash
     touch day-01/.gitkeep
     git add day-01/.gitkeep
     ```

3. **Add Files:**

   - After handling submodules or empty directories, try adding files again.
     ```bash
     git add .
     ```

4. **Commit and Push:**
   - Proceed with committing your changes and pushing them to the remote repository.
     ```bash
     git commit -m "Your commit message"
     git push origin main
     ```

If the issue persists or if you need further assistance, please provide more details about the structure of your repository and the content of the "day-01/" directory.
